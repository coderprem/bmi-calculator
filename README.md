# üì± BMI Calculator App

## Description üìù

The BMI Calculator App is a simple application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The BMI is a widely used measure for assessing whether a person has a healthy body weight based on their height and weight.

The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their height and weight, and it instantly calculates and displays their BMI. Additionally, the app provides a brief interpretation of the BMI value, indicating whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese according to standard BMI categories.

This app is helpful in various situations, including:

- Personal health management: Users can track their BMI regularly to monitor changes in their body weight and assess their progress towards their health goals.

- Fitness and weight management: The app can be used by individuals who are actively working on improving their fitness or managing their weight. It provides a quick way to gauge their current body weight status.

- Healthcare professionals: Healthcare professionals, such as doctors, nutritionists, or fitness trainers, can recommend this app to their patients or clients for easy BMI calculations.
